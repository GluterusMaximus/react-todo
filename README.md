## About

This is a simple todo app with task priority feature and deadlines. More to come.

## Technology stack

- **JavaScript**

  I chose JavaScript over TypeScript primarily because of the speed of development (writing JavaScript  
  is usually faster upfront, plus I have no experience with TypeScript which might also slow  
  me down), and also because this project is relatively small.

- **Express**

  Once again, I choose express over other frameworks because of the scale of the project and  
  some prior experience with it.

- **MongoDB + Mongoose**

  MongoDB is a document-oriented database program, which makes it much easier to work with. It also is  
  has a large community of users that can provide help. Mongoose is an ODM for MongoDB.
